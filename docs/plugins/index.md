# Extending docmd with Plugins

`docmd` supports a plugin system to add extra features and integrations to your documentation site without bloating the core tool. Plugins can modify the build process, inject content into pages, or add site-wide functionalities.

## Enabling Plugins

You enable and configure plugins in your `config.js` file within the `plugins` object. Each plugin is configured using its key with a corresponding configuration object.

```javascript
// config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... other config ...
  plugins: {
    // SEO Plugin
    seo: {
      defaultDescription: 'Your site-wide meta description',
      openGraph: {
        defaultImage: '/assets/images/og-preview.png',
      },
    },
    // Analytics Plugin
    analytics: {
      googleV4: {
        measurementId: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX'
      }
    },
    // Sitemap Plugin
    sitemap: {
      defaultChangefreq: 'weekly',
      defaultPriority: 0.8
    }
  },
  // ...
};
```

## Core Plugins

`docmd` ships with several core plugins that you can easily enable:

* **[SEO & Meta Tags](/plugins/seo/):** Automatically generates common SEO-related meta tags (description, Open Graph, Twitter Cards).
* **[Analytics Integration](/plugins/analytics/):** Easily add tracking snippets for popular web analytics services like Google Analytics.
* **[Sitemap](/plugins/sitemap/):** Generates a sitemap.xml file for search engines to better discover and index your content.

Click on the links above or see the sidebar for detailed configuration of each core plugin.

## How Plugins Work

Plugins in `docmd` hook into various parts of the build process:

* They can add meta tags and scripts to the page head
* They can inject content or scripts at the beginning or end of the page body
* They can generate additional files in the output directory
* They can modify the HTML output of pages

All plugins are designed to be configurable through your `config.js` file, giving you control over their behavior.

## Future Plugin Development

The plugin system is designed with future extensibility in mind. As `docmd` evolves, we plan to:

* Add more built-in plugins for common documentation needs
* Create an API for developers to build custom plugins
* Enable community contribution of third-party plugins

For now, focus on utilizing the available core plugins to enhance your site's functionality.
