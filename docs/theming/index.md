# Theming Your docmd Site

`docmd` allows for extensive customization of your documentation site's appearance, ensuring it aligns with your branding and provides an optimal user experience.

## Core Theming Concepts:

*   **[Available Themes](/theming/available-themes/):** Choose from pre-built themes to quickly change the overall look and feel.
*   **[Light & Dark Mode](/theming/light-dark-mode/):** Understand how to set the default color mode and enable user toggling.
*   **[Custom CSS & JS](/theming/custom-css-js/):** Inject your own CSS and JavaScript files for fine-grained control over styling and functionality.
*   **[Using Icons](/theming/icons/):** Enhance navigation and content with SVG icons.
*   **CSS Variables:** The default theme (`default`) is built using CSS variables, making it easier to tweak common properties like colors and fonts via your custom CSS.
*   **Syntax Highlighting:** Code block themes are provided for both light and dark modes via `highlight.js` stylesheets, adapting to the current color mode.

The goal is to provide a good-looking, accessible site out-of-the-box, with straightforward ways to adapt it to your specific needs.
