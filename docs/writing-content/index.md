# Writing Content

`docmd` is designed to let you focus on your content, written in standard Markdown. This section covers the essentials of creating pages, structuring your content, and leveraging `docmd`'s features to enhance your documentation.

## Key Aspects:

*   **[Frontmatter](/writing-content/frontmatter/):** Define page-specific metadata like titles and descriptions using simple YAML at the top of your Markdown files.
*   **[Markdown Syntax](/writing-content/markdown-syntax/):** Utilize standard CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown for formatting your text, code blocks, lists, tables, and more.
*   **[Custom Containers](/writing-content/custom-containers/):** Enhance your pages with special components like callouts, cards, and steps using a simple `::: name :::` syntax.
*   **[Steps Container](/writing-content/steps-test/):** Create sequential guides with the specialized steps container.

By understanding these elements, you can create rich, well-structured, and engaging documentation.
