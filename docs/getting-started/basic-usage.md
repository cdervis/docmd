# Basic Usage

Once `docmd` is [installed](/getting-started/installation/), using it involves a few simple commands to manage your documentation project.

## 1. Initialize Your Project (`docmd init`)

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your documentation project. If the directory doesn't exist, create it first.

```bash
mkdir my-awesome-docs
cd my-awesome-docs
```

Then, run the `init` command:

```bash
docmd init
```

This command sets up the basic structure for your `docmd` project:

*   `docs/`: An empty directory where your Markdown source files will live.
    *   `docs/index.md`: A sample Markdown file to get you started.
*   `config.js`: A configuration file for your site, pre-filled with sensible defaults.

You'll typically edit `config.js` to set your site title and define the navigation structure, and then start adding your `.md` files to the `docs/` directory.

## 2. Add and Structure Content

Create your Markdown (`.md`) files inside the `docs/` directory. You can organize them into subdirectories as needed. For example:

```
my-awesome-docs/
├── assets/
├── docs/
│   ├── index.md
│   └── api/
│       ├── introduction.md
│       └── endpoints.md
│   └── guides/
│       ├── setup.md
│       └── advanced.md
└── config.js
```

Each Markdown file should start with YAML frontmatter to define metadata like the page title. See [Content > Frontmatter](/content/frontmatter/) for details.

## 3. Preview Your Site (`docmd dev`)

While you're writing content or configuring your site, you'll want to see a live preview. The `dev` command starts a local development server with live reloading.

In your project's root directory (e.g., `my-awesome-docs/`), run:

```bash
docmd dev
```

This will:
1.  Perform an initial build of your site.
2.  Start a web server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.
3.  Watch your `docs/` directory and `config.js` for changes.
4.  Automatically rebuild the site and refresh your browser when changes are detected.

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to see your site. Any changes you save to your Markdown files or `config.js` will be reflected live in the browser.

To stop the development server, press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.

## 4. Build Your Static Site (`docmd build`)

When you're ready to deploy your documentation or create a production version, use the `build` command:

```bash
docmd build
```

This command:
1.  Reads your `config.js`.
2.  Processes all `.md` files in your `docs/` directory.
3.  Generates the complete static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets.
4.  Outputs the entire site into a `site/` directory (by default, configurable in `config.js`).

The contents of the `site/` directory are all you need to deploy your documentation. You can upload this folder to any static web hosting provider. See [Deployment](/deployment/) for more information.

This covers the fundamental workflow of using `docmd`. Next, you'll want to learn more about [Content](/content/) and [Configuration](/configuration/).
