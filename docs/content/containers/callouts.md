# Callouts

Callouts are perfect for drawing the user's attention to a specific piece of information. They are visually distinct from the regular text and are ideal for tips, warnings, and important notes.

## Usage

The basic syntax uses the `callout` container name, followed by the callout type.

::: callout info
Container blocks (like `::: callout`) should be preceded by a blank line to ensure proper parsing by the markdown processor.
:::

**Syntax:**
```markdown
::: callout type
The main content of the callout.
:::
```

**With Custom Title:**
```markdown
::: callout type Custom Title Here
The main content of the callout.
:::
```

**Parameters:**
*   `type`: The type determines the color and styling of the callout. Available types are: `info`, `tip`, `warning`, `danger`, `success`.
*   `Custom Title Here` (optional): Any text following the type becomes the callout title.

::: callout info Auto Emojis
Some themes (like Sky) automatically add emojis to callout titles: ‚ÑπÔ∏è for info, ‚ö†Ô∏è for warning, üí° for tip, üö® for danger, and ‚úÖ for success.
