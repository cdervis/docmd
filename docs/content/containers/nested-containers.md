# Nested Containers

The advanced nested container system in docmd allows you to create complex, interactive documentation layouts by nesting containers within each other. This powerful feature enables you to build rich, structured content that was previously impossible.

## Overview

With docmd v0.2.0, you can nest containers seamlessly:

- **Cards within Tabs** - Organize content into structured sections within tabs
- **Callouts within Cards** - Add informational content within structured cards
- **Buttons within Any Container** - Place action buttons in any context
- **Multiple Levels of Nesting** - Support for complex nested structures up to 7+ levels
- **Steps for Simple Sequences** - Use steps containers for straightforward, sequential instructions

## Container Nesting Rules

### Supported Nesting Combinations

| Container | Can Nest Inside | Can Contain |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Callouts** | Any container | Any container |
| **Cards** | Any container | Any container |
| **Buttons** | Any container | None (self-closing) |
| **Steps** | Any container (except tabs) | Any container (except tabs) |
| **Tabs** | Any container (except steps) | Any container (except tabs, steps) |

### Nesting Best Practices

1. **Logical Structure** - Nest containers in a way that makes logical sense
2. **Readability** - Don't nest too deeply (3-4 levels maximum for readability)
3. **Performance** - Complex nesting is supported but keep it reasonable
4. **Content Organization** - Use nesting to organize related content
5. **Use the Right Tool** - Use steps for simple sequences, cards/tabs for complex content

### Nesting Limitations

::: callout error Known Issues
**Steps â†” Tabs Incompatibility:** Steps and tabs containers cannot be nested within each other due to parsing complexity. Use them as separate sections instead.
:::

- **Tabs cannot contain tabs** - This prevents infinite recursion
- **Tabs cannot contain steps** - Due to parsing conflicts with markdown processing
- **Steps cannot contain tabs** - Due to parsing complexity 
- **Steps cannot be inside tabs** - Due to container recognition issues
- **Maximum depth** - While technically unlimited, keep it under 7 levels for readability
- **Performance** - Very deep nesting may impact rendering performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container not rendering** - Ensure proper spacing and syntax
2. **Nested content not showing** - Check for proper closing tags
3. **Performance issues** - Reduce nesting depth if experiencing slowdowns

### Debugging Tips

- **Check syntax** - Ensure all containers have proper opening and closing tags
- **Verify nesting** - Make sure containers are properly nested
- **Test incrementally** - Build complex structures step by step
- **Use browser dev tools** - Inspect the generated HTML for issues
- **Use the right container** - Steps for simple sequences, cards/tabs for complex content

## Migration from v0.1.x

### Breaking Changes

- **Container parsing** - The internal parsing system has been optimized for reliability
- **Nesting behavior** - Most containers support seamless nesting

### What's New

- **Enhanced nesting** - Cards, tabs, callouts, and buttons support seamless nesting
- **Better performance** - Improved parsing performance for complex structures
- **Clear limitations** - Well-defined boundaries for what each container can do

### Backward Compatibility

- **Existing syntax** - All existing container syntax remains the same
- **Enhanced functionality** - New nesting capabilities are additive for supported containers

## Future Container Types

The nested container system is designed to be easily extensible. Future container types that could be added include:

- **Timeline containers** - For chronological content
- **Changelog containers** - For version history
- **FAQ containers** - For question-answer content
- **Gallery containers** - For image collections
- **Code playground containers** - For interactive code examples

The architecture supports adding new containers by simply defining them in the containers object and implementing their render functions.
